I'm heading off but https://github.com/simba-sleep/node-divido-api has
two outstanding PRs, one for a swagger spec (which has been sent to
Divido) and one for the api implementing this spec. The api is
basically done, but the auth is not done at all, and it could do with
better logging. It will also need to be deployed in some way.
