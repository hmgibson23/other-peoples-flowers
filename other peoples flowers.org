Thanks so much for sending us your story. We really enjoyed it and hopefully you'll think of us again in the future.Â 

Best Wishes,

P.S. If you want help promote your work, the best thing you can do is give us a positive (or negative!) review on whichever podcast platform you listen on.

Hi Michael,

We'd love to feature The Squall on the show. There's nothing you need to do at this stage. We will record it and released it in the next couple of weeks and let you know once we've released. If you want to withdraw it for any reason, then please let us know and we won't record it.

Sometimes stories have been accepted elsewhere in print. Usually we can record it as well, but it's up to the print magazine so if this is the case and you still want us to record it, let us know.

Many thanks,
Hugo

This week we're featuring a short story by Steve Carr, called a A
Woman of the Arts.

Steve Carr, who lives in Richmond, Va., began his writing career as a military journalist and has had over 170 short stories published internationally in print and online magazines, literary journals and anthologies. Sand, a collection of his short stories, was published recently by Clarendon House Books. His plays have been produced in several states in the U.S. He was a 2017 Pushcart Prize nominee.

Other People's Flowers is the podcast that showcases short stories, essays, and reportage. We're the first podcast-based literary journal. People hardly read journals anymore so we hope you'll listen instead.

If you'd like to have your work featured on the show, please send it to editor@otherpeoplesflowers.com
