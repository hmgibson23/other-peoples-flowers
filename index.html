                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Other People's Flowers is a podcast to give voice to stories, essays, and poems.</p>
                <p>Some people like to listen to stories, some people prefer to read them. We are for the people who like to listen to stories.</p>
                <p>We give writers voice by reading their work out on our podcast. We don't mind where you are from, who you are, what you do, and what your political inclincations might be. We just want writing you want to be read out loud.</p>
                <p>If you want to have your work featured, please see our submission guidelines below.</p>

                <h2>Submit</h2>
                <p>Please send your work to <a href="mailto:editor@otherpeoplesflowers.com">editor@otherpeoplesflowers.com</a>. Please include the title of the work and your name in the email title.</p>
                <p>Pieces should be no longer than 6,000 words.</p>
                <p>Manuscripts should be double-spaced, 12pt font, preferably Times New Roman. Formats can be .doc, .docx, .pdf, or .odt. We actually prefer .odt.</p>
                <p>Please also include a third person bio in your cover email.</p>
                <p>We accept simultaneous submissions but please let us know if you're work is accepted elsewhere. In some cases, print or online publications have no problem with us maintaining the audio rights alongside their print copy, so we may be able to record your work regardless.</p>

                <p>As for rights, we ask to be given the audio rights to your work only, and have no problem with a story we've recorded being submitted and published in a print or online publication. This is the same for reprints.</p>

                <p>Please note that while we'd love to feature everyone's work, releasing things via a podcast is just not possible. We only have limited time to record. </p>
                <p>We read everything, and will work with you to edit it if we want to record it.</p>
