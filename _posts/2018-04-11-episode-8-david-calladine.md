This week's episode features a short story by David Calladine about a
young man attending the funeral for a grandfather he didn't
know. David Calladine is a former software engineer and now writer and
freelance journalist. He lives and works in the Dublin area. Other
People's Flowers is the podcast that showcases short stories, essays,
and reportage. We're the first podcast-based literary journal. People
hardly read journals anymore so we hope you'll listen instead.
