This week's episode features a collection of stories and poems by Silé
Mannion, Conversations with my Mother.


Silé is an Irish writer living
in New Zealand. When she can write, she writes. When she can't, she
reads. On occasion, she plays the ukulele. Other People's Flowers is
the podcast that showcases short stories, essays, and reportage. We're
the first podcast-based literary journal. People hardly read journals
anymore so we hope you'll listen instead.
