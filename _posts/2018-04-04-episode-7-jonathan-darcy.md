This week's episode features a short story by Jonathan D'Arcy about a
Classics teacher who gets left behind by society while trying to
follow him dreams. He finds himself caught up in a web of deceit and
lies that leaves him questioning many of his life choices. Jonathan
D'Arcy is an Irish writer living in the North East of England. He's
been teaching for many years and is currently doing a PhD in
Comparative Literature. Other People's Flowers is the podcast that
showcases short stories, essays, and reportage. We're the first
podcast-based literary journal. People hardly read journals anymore so
we hope you'll listen instead.
