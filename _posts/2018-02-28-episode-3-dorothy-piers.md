This week we feature a story by Dorothy Piers, Inscription. It's about
someone who finds an inscription in the front of a book by W. Somerset
Maugham and imagines who would throw away a book with an inscription
in it and for what reason. Dorothy is a writer and illustrator living
in North London. Other than her cats, writing is her great passion.
