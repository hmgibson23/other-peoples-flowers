This week we're featuring a short piece by Paige Olausen, Disclaimer. Paige Noel is a hobbyist writer and college student. Paige is an environmentalist by training but uses writing as an outlet. The piece is a disclaimer and in a way a love-ish letter. It was a scary moment that tested her trust, a step forward in a relationship.
