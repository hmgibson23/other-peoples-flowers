This week we feature a story by Robert Davies about the perils of
online dating. It's a comic short story about a man who's first
experience in the world of online dating goes horribly wrong. Robert
Davies is a standup comic and writer living in London. His work has
been featured in Granta, Paris Lit Up and The Cadaverine. He often
writes under a pseudonym. Other People's Flowers is the podcast that
showcases short stories, essays, and reportage. We're the first
podcast literary journal. People hardly read journals anymore so we
hope you'll listen instead.
