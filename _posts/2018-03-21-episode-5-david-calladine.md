This week we feature a story by David Calladine, Pity Friends, about a
man visiting some of his artist friends who've retired from the bustle
of city life to go and live a life of art and relative poverty in
Ireland. David Calladine is a former software engineer and now writer
and freelance journalist. He lives and works in the Dublin area. Other
People's Flowers is the podcast that showcases short stories, essays,
and reportage. We're the first podcast-based literary journal. People
hardly read journals anymore so we hope you'll listen instead.
