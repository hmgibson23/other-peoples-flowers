This week's story comes from Jemma Prandial, We Don't Do Catholics
Here. It's about a non-religious mission in Africa and how the
volunteers there start to question their atheism when an Islamist
insurgency starts to run through the country. Jemma is a humanist and
novelist living in Kenya. She has been writing under various
pseudonyms for many years and prefers to be anonymous and
unrecognisable when writing. Other People's Flowers is the podcast
that showcases short stories, essays, and reportage. We're the first
podcast-based literary journal. People hardly read journals anymore so
we hope you'll listen instead.
