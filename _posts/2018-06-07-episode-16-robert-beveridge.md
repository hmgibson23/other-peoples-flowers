This week we're featuring a selection of poetry by Robert Beveridge.

Robert Beveridge makes noise (xterminal.bandcamp.com) and writes
poetry in Akron, OH. Recent/upcoming appearances in The Nixes Mate
Review, Violet Rising, and The Road Less Travelled, among
others. Other People's Flowers is the podcast that showcases short
stories, essays, and reportage. We're the first podcast-based literary
journal. People hardly read journals anymore so we hope you'll listen
instead.
