This week's episode features a collection of stories by Patricia
Lawler Kenet.

Patricia Lawler Kenet is a journalist, semi-retired lawyer and
entrepreneur. Her work has appeared in Slate.com, The Fiction Pool and
Mutha Magazine. Other People's Flowers is the podcast that showcases
short stories, essays, and reportage. We're the first podcast-based
literary journal. People hardly read journals anymore so we hope
you'll listen instead.
