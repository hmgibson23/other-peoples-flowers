This week we're featuring a story by Ted DeMarsh, Sweet Run. It's
about a young girl's visit to the annual market fair and a young boy
she meets there.

Edward Michael DeMarsh usually works in script form
for TV and Film, though he has enjoyed writing shorter work in prose
and has been published by, ONSpec, London Business Magazine and
Postcard fiction among others. He lives in Toronto, Canada and is
grateful to have a beach at the end of his big city block. Other
People's Flowers is the podcast that showcases short stories, essays,
and reportage. We're the first podcast-based literary journal. People
hardly read journals anymore so we hope you'll listen instead.
