This week's episode features a short story, Toms-Tom, by Thomas Healy,
about a man coming to terms with his cousin's death and what it means
to face life without him.

T.R. Healy was born and raised in the Pacific
Northwest and his stories have appeared in such publications as Crux,
Hawaii Review, Scrutiny, and Welter. Other People's Flowers is the
podcast that showcases short stories, essays, and reportage. We're the
first podcast-based literary journal. People hardly read journals
anymore so we hope you'll listen instead.
