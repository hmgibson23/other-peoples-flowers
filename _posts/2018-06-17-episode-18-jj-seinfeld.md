This week we're featuring a selection of poetry byt
J.J. Steinfeld. Canadian fiction writer, poet, and playwright

J. J. Steinfeld lives on Prince Edward Island, where he is patiently

waiting, he has published eighteen books, including Would You Hide Me?
(Stories, Gaspereau Press, 2003), Misshapenness (Poetry, Ekstasis

Editions, 2014), Madhouses in Heaven, Castles in Hell (Stories,

Guernica Editions, 2017). His short stories and poems have appeared in
numerous anthologies and periodicals internationally, and over fifty
of his one-act plays and a handful of full-length plays have been
performed in Canada and the United States.
