This week we're featuring poetry by Jeffery Berg.

Jeffery Berg's poems have appeared in Impossible Archetype, El Balazo Press, glitterMOB,
the Leveler, Court Green, Rove, Map Literary, Assaracus and Harpur
Palate, and No, Dear. A Virginia Center of the Creative Arts fellow,
Jeffery lives in Jersey City and blogs at jdbrecords. Other People's
Flowers is the podcast that showcases short stories, essays, and
reportage. We're the first podcast-based literary journal.

People hardly read journals anymore so we hope you'll listen instead. If you'd like to have your work featured on the show, please send it to editor@otherpeoplesflowers.com http://www.otherpeoplesflowers.com
