This week we're featuring a short story by Stephen McGuiggan, Let this Damn Day Break. Stephen McQuiggan was the original author of the bible; he vowed never to write again after the publishers removed the dinosaurs and the spectacular alien abduction ending from the final edit. His other, lesser known, novels are A Pigâ€™s View Of Heaven and Trip A Dwarf.
