This week we're featuring work by two poets: Veronica Fitzhugh and
Robert Okaji.

Robert Okaji lives in Texas with his wife, two dogs and
some books. The author of five chapbooks, his work has appeared in
such publications as Clade Song, Vox Populi, Boston Review, The High
Window, MockingHeart Review and Main Street Rag.

Veronica Haunani Fitzhugh earned her BA in English Literature from the University of
Virginia but is more proud of the friendships she earned through her
social justice work in Charlottesville, Virginia. She has been in
several anthologies online and in print. Her main blog is
Charlottesville Winter at cvillewinter.wordpress.org. Other People's
Flowers is the podcast that showcases short stories, essays, and
reportage. We're the first podcast-based literary journal. People
hardly read journals anymore so we hope you'll listen instead.
